# OS-lab6-profiling

We will use Visual Studio for profiling.

This is result for initial program:
![prof-1](./img/prof_1.jpg)

As we can see function "sleep" takes the most time
![prof-2](./img/prof_2.jpg)

Also we can see that all that this program is doing - is summing two numbers, so we can delete all redundant code. After that we get this:
![code-3](./img/code_3.jpg)
![prof-3](./img/prof_3.jpg)
